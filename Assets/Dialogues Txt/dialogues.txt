Where does everything come from?
What? Everything we own?
We buy things. People go to work, make money,
and then buy everything they want.
No, that's not what I mean.
What I mean is, where did everything start?
Water, plants, animals. Where do they come from?
Oh, you're a very smart kid, aren't you?
We could do some research about it. What do you think?

Show him The Holy Book.
Tell him the truth.
Don't let his mind be filled with pretentious lies.
Get rid of them.
Let The Book be his source of knowledge.
God Wills It.

//
The God made us all.
He created the world we live in,
and everything in it.

//
We are the result of evolution,
that started thousands of cycles ago.
Science gives you all the answers you're looking for.

//
Good morning darling. Enjoying yourself?
Morning! Check this out!

So? Do you like it?

//
What do you want me to tell him?
Art is corrupting his soul.
Leading him to the Land of Lost Souls.
You must get rid of his music.
Do it for him. He will thank you one day.
God wills it.

//
Do you like it or not?

"Winston believes that as long as his rebellious spirit is intact,
the Party can not triumph."

Do you want to join me and watch this?
Well... I...

//
Do not let his mind be controlled.
Stand for his future.
Watch the Party talk.
Let them teach him what the right way is.
Let them shape his mind.
Trust them.
Get rid of his rebellious nature.
God wills it.

//
You're a grown-up now.
You should be watching the Party
and get informed on what happens around you.

//
Hey. I have a question for you.
What do you want to know, darling?
What is love?
...

//
You must tell him the truth.
You must show him the right and only way.
You are made for reproduction.
There is nothing else you need.
Love is between a man and a woman.
Get rid of his bad thoughts.
God wills it.

//
Love is a very strong feeling.
I don't have to explain this to you.
You will understand when you find it.

//
Love is a very strong feeling.
It is between a man and a woman.
God gifted us with it, and we have to pay him back
by keeping his creatures alive.

//
Hey. I have to introduce you to him.
You told me what love is.
I think I'm in love with him.

//
Hey. I have to introduce you to him.
You told me what love is but I still don't understand.
I feel something strong for him.
I think I'm in love with him.

//
This is getting out of your control.
It is too late to bring him back to the right path.
You must save his soul now.
You must do it before it is too late.
You must get rid of him.
God wills it.

//
You bring dishonour to this family.
You disappoint me.
You must leave.
God wills it.

//
I'm happy son.
You deserve to be happy too.

Wait! Who are you? I didn't let you in.
What are you doing to him? Let him go!
Let me go! Where are you bringing us?
Where's my God?
Where's my God?!
